# I created this app as a sample of my code, it includes many...things such as CRUD ops, ISR and CSR, typescript, redux, Nextjs 12 and how to combine them together, SASS modules and global styling, dark/light modes, basic Client side Authentication and many to be implemented when I got the time such as progressive web app features, unit testing, social websites and server side auth

# Notes
- SSR/SSG: I used ISR in one page as an example which is /articles/ARTICLE_ID, the rest of the page uses client side fetching
- SASS: I used SASS modules for pages and global sass for the components to save time
- the post/put/delete requests won't be commited to the DB, they will be handled on client side so your changes won't appear in /articles/ARTICLE_ID (because this page is created in build time)
